Fileserver

I am thinking that I want to do this on a backend server in node.js
Have my home computer seach the 20mb index and spit results.
Right now I feel like why upload a huge index to find and upload only 10kb's.

If I should do this then let me know.
Becuase I don't belive I have CPU access like that on the webhost, not sure
